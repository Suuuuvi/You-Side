# You-Side

The project seeks to reinterpret the Chinese pop ballad 'One Day You Will Be By My Side' through coding. I will create a piece that resonates with the essence of the original song, expressing my personal emotions by Python programming language - saying goodbye to the past while looking forward to the future. For me, the song represents hope and serves as an inspiration to maintain faith in life. Through this work, I aim to convey my feeling and experiences in a musical format, sharing a message of positivity.

# Introduction

- **Problem Solved**

This project aims to express emotions through music, helping people find hope and courage when facing lifeâ€™s challenges. The original song reflects expectations for the future and a farewell to the past. I hope to reinterpret it through TunePad, allowing more people to experience this positive emotion.

- **Purpose of the Project**

The main goal is to use Python to create a musical piece that resonates with the original song and reflects my personal emotional journey. Through music, I aim to express my love for life, acceptance of the past, and vision for the future, inspiring others to maintain faith and move forward bravely.

- **Reason for the Project**

This project is driven by the profound impact this song has had on my life, providing me with hope and courage during difficult times. By transforming these feelings into code and music, I hope to share this power and inspiration with others, allowing them to feel the same uplifting emotions when they listen to it
