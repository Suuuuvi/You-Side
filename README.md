# You-Side

The project seeks to reinterpret the Chinese pop ballad 'One Day You Will Be By My Side' through coding. I will create a piece that resonates with the essence of the original song, expressing my personal emotions by Python programming language - saying goodbye to the past while looking forward to the future. For me, the song represents hope and serves as an inspiration to maintain faith in life. Through this work, I aim to convey my feeling and experiences in a musical format, sharing a message of positivity.
